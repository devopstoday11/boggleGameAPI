Design Decisions

I chose to store the game board as a pickle file since the board is going to be
represented as a list of 4 letters, or a 4x4 value matrix. This seemed the easiest way
to handle the storing of the board information.
I also chose to store the user path as a list of tuples to easily compare this path
against all possible paths in the matrix. However, I represented this value as a 
string in order to use python interpreter to evalaute the tuple of tuples and then
return this value back to the user. The algorithm for finding solutions to the board
also worked the best in a tuple format, since tuples are nicely set up to store
and retrieve data rather quickly. Finally, I decided to have the chron job email the user every day with a list of the current games they are playing rather than every hour, since
this would annoy the user. In the future I plan on adding an unsubsrcibe feature
to user preferences so they can opt out of receiving email notifications.
